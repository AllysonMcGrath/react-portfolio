# Coding Bootcamp Portfolio-React

## Description

The purpose of this project was to use React to create a portfolio for our work in the coding bootcamp. This required knowledge of React, HTML, and CSS. The portfolio had to have a home page with an author image and bio, a page with a gallery of projects, a page to contact the creator, and a page with a resume and listed skills.
